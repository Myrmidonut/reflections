When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- A remote repository allows accesing the commits from different computers, or for different users working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Maybe changes on the remote repository are not necessary for what you are working on locally.
